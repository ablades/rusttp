## Variables and Mutability
Variables are immutable by default.

```rust
fn main() {
    
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is {}", x);

    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let yy: f32 = 3.0; // f32


    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;

    let t = true;

    // explicit type annotation
    let f: bool = false;

    //char - unicode scalar value
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'â„¤';
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';

    //tuple type
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    //multiple assignment - destructuring
    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    //assignment of value by tuple index
    let five_hundred = tup.0;

    //arrays are fixed in size - good for constants (months in a year)
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    //array that specifys type and size
    let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    //array that specifys value and allocations of that value [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
    let a = [3; 5];

    a[0] // get first element
    //vectors are scalable in size

}
```

## Functions
**Statements** are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- function definitions are statements
- setting a variable is a statement
- statements end in a semicolon

**Expressions** evaluate to a resulting value.
- expressions do not end in a semicolon!

```rust
//function signature with parameter name: type
fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

    //6 is an expression that evaluates to 6
    let y = 6;
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    //inner is an expression that assigns y to be x + 1
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}

//return type is i32
//functions automatically return the last expression implicitly
fn five() -> i32 {
    5 //implicit return
}

let x = five();

fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

```

## Control Flow

```rust
//Match may be a good alternative for lots of else if statements
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}

// if in variable assignment
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };



    fn main() {
        let mut counter = 0;
        //variable assignment  of a loop. value is assigned to result on break
        let result = loop {
            counter += 1;

            if counter == 10 {
                break counter * 2;
            }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);

    //While Loops
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    //for loops
    fn main() {
        let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

        for element in a.iter() {
            println!("the value is: {}", element);
        }
    }   

    fn main() {
        //typical way to do a while loop in rust rev reverses the range
        for number in (1..4).rev() {
            println!("{}!", number);
        }
        println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
    }
}

```

## Ownership

Rust language behaves differently differently based on wheter or not a value is on the stack or allocated onto the heap.

Stack - stores values, must have a known, fixed size. Pushing to stack fast

Heap - data in unkown size or size that may change should be on the heap. Searches for location, returns pointer. Allocating to heap slower.

String:: is allocated on heap, literals are not since by default they are immutable.

### Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has a variable called its owner.
- Can only have one owner at a time.
- When owner is out of scope, values are dropped.
